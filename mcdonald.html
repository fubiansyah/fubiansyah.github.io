              <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
              <p>The Main purpose of using a digital menu board was to create a different level of customer experience in-store. Digital menu boards are the perfect solution to improve the ordering experience, bringing restaurant menus to life with videos and animations. Content from the digital menu board can be displayed and easily updated, providing value-added information to diners. </p>
              <p>While developing the digital menu board we encountered 2 of Customer habits, </p>
              <ul>
                <li><u>the customer that has decided  what they want to buy</u> </li>
                <li><u>and the other one is the one that didn’t know what they want to buy.</u> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Meanwhile they need to up-sell  their limited time menu (seasonal menu). </p>
              <p>Based on those issue, We got the point from their business objective to create some of <i>"key point"</i> of the Digital menu Board  </p>
              <p>here the <i>"key point"</i> Objective That We get:</p>
              <ul style="list-style: decimal">
                <li><b>How to improve customer experience by making decision easier</b> </li>
                <li><b>How to promote high value item</b> </li>
                <li><b>How to Increase engagement with impactful visuals</b> </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
              <h4>How to improve customer experience by making decision easier</h4>
              <p>The Digital Menu Board will consist of 2 orientation views (depending on store layout ) Horizontal (landscape view ) and Vertical (portrait view). In early 2016 each store will be installed with a 5 screen Digital menu Board.</p>
              <p>To making the customer easy to making decision We try to re-grouping the menu</p>
              <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;font-weight: bold;">
                <li><b>Normal menu (the menu will stay over there and really rare to changes)</b> </li>
                <li><b>Limited time offer Menu (seasonal menu)</b> </li>
                <li><b>Beverage Menu</b></li>
                <li><b>Happy Meal </b> </li>

              <p><b>Normal menu</b> will be placed in screen number 1 and number 2, and the screen will be put behind the Cashier order, the reason is to make the customer clearly read the main product information such as menu price. </p>
              <p><b>Limited time offer menu</b> will be placed in screen number 3 (center monitor) and we will give some of animation to made the menu more interactive and become center of attention so user will notice regarding the Seasonal Menu </p>
              <p><b>Beverage menu</b> will be placed on screen number 4. We decided to put the beverage menu after the seasonal menu price,  the reason is we will also put some of the McCafe menu on the board so it will be such a teaser for the McCafe drink. </p>
              <p><b>Happy meal menu</b> will be placed on screen number 5 (Last Screen) . The Happy meal is also the signature menu. They want to sell the Happy Meal Toy’s together with the meal. So We made it as a single stand alone content with smiling animation for the happy meal Box. </p>

              <h4>How to promote high value item</h4>
              <p>High value item was the signature menu. to make it a Center of attention, the high value item must be really interactive,  which means we need to put outstanding animation into it. We need to make the high value item as attractive as well  so everyone notices and decides to move and buy the item. </p>
              <p>Here the Animation that We do for the <b>High value item</b> </p>

              <h4>How to Increase engagement with impactful visuals</h4>
              <p>The last key objective was so challenging to Us. As a frontend developer I need to deliver the content that might be impactful to the customer. Not just a good picture of the menu, the technology that I'm using to develop the content also very decisive on the performance of the content. We try to suggest the thematic Digital Menu board with the latest technology to support the performance of the content.</p>

                <h5>Rest Of Day (Lunch) Thematic Menu</h5>
                <p>Thinking about Lunch we try to imagine sitting down on the cloudy  park with the table full of food.. Quite interesting..  All of the food will be put on the wooden table..<br><br>So here we go our Rest Of Day thematic Menu</p>
                <section class="detail_images">
                  <div class="container">
                    <div class="images-wrapper"><img src="images/mcdonald/rod-preview.png"><span>Lunch Thematic Menu</span></div>

                <h5>Breakfast Thematic Menu</h5>
                <p>We are thinking of eating Breakfast with clear fresh air and the coffee on the table. Oh wait, breakfast is family time so we try to bring the family Meal thematic menu in the restaurant.<br><br>Here we go our Breakfast Menu for Mcdonald’s Digital menu board</p>
                <section class="detail_images">
                  <div class="container">

                <h5>Night Part Thematic Menu</h5>
                <p>We need to align all of the thematic menu means, we need to follow the core of design from the breakfast menu and lunch menu. As We can see, we are using wooden tables for both the breakfast and lunch menu. So we don't want to change the wooden table. We just needed to make the wooden table darker, We decided to change the wooden table look. For the background We imagine the night with city lamp around us.<br><br>so here we go our Night part thematic menu</p>

              <h4 style="margin-top: 2%;">Digital Menu Board Content technology</h4>
              <p>The Digital menu board was controlled by the CMS. The cms only allows uploading the content with HTML format. So we are using the latest <b>HTML 5</b> and <b>CSS 3</b> technology to develop the content. As We use HTML for content developing  We can do so many things, not just putting the video inside the content, but We can also make the content trigger the dynamic weather outside. I was thinking of making the content more dynamic following the weather outside. It's like when it's a rainy day We can only show a hot beverage menu.</p>
              <p>Animation from the content can be handled from <b>javascript</b>, we use <b>jquery</b> to handle the animation.</p>
              <p>However the content also needs to connect to the CMS API.  i can say that the cms system was so powerful. By connecting the content into the CMS API we can do anything like <b>make the price of the menu more dynamic by following the POS pricing.</b> </p>

              <h4 style="margin-top: 2%;">In Conclusion</h4>
              <p>Digital menu boards are the perfect solution to improve the ordering experience, bringing restaurant menus to life with videos and animations. </p>
              <p>With digital menu boards, restaurant owners can easily update menu items, promotions and prices in real-time by simply revising the data in the content management system. </p>
              <p>Digital menu boards present a huge opportunity for upsells and help to boost revenue. Based on orders entered in a POS system, the digital screens can display complementary items. It is an excellent tool for restaurants that offer combos and menu add-ons like sides, drinks, and desserts. </p>
              <p>Static menu boards require additional resources to print and install the materials. On the other hand, digital menu boards eliminate the costs of printing and installation, and promote environmental sustainability.</p>
