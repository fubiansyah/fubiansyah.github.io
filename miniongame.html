              <p>Who doesn’t love the Discount promotion?? Every single person in the world is looking for a discount promotion unless they are crazy rich enough to ignore any discount. </p>
              <p>Mcdonald’s has an order App’s (McDelivery App’s) which allows people to order the food via their app’s. The App’s also offer so many discount promotions.  But the marketing team thinks that it will be great to give some fun challenges to get the discount promotion code. </p>
              <p>Instead of just letting the user use the “discount” promotion by clicking the promo code,  the marketing team tries to give the best experience while using the Apps to get the discount promotion. “The In App’s Game” ~ the way to make user feel the fun experience inside the App’s</p>

              <p>The Marketing Team wants to create a simple Game with "Fun" Minion Experience. Small interaction but getting “Fun” experience it's their main purpose. They don't want to make users feel the game is too hard because they just want to get a discount promotion. </p>
              <p>They want to seperate the Game into 2 Phase</p>
              <h5>Phase 1</h5>

              <p>It will get attraction from users so they  will tap  on either tile to play the game. </p>
              <h5>Audio Select Page</h5>
              <p>After clicking on the tile, user is directed to the loading page where they can choose to play the game with or without audio. </p>
              <p>Loading page begins already with audio playing to give user a taste of the full visual + audio experience from the beginning.</p>
              <div class="center_images small-images"><img src="images/mcdelivery/game-audio.png"></div>

              <p>2. User taps the gift box and Minion flies in with visual effects. Either Kevin or Stuart will appear (at random) every time the User taps the screen.</p>
              <div class="center_images small-images"><img src="images/mcdelivery/second-journey.png"></div>
              <p>3. After 5 punches/kicks, the gift box shakes &amp; opens to reveal the game prize.</p>

              <h4>Game Preview</h4>
              <div class="center_images"><img src="images/mcdelivery/gameplay.gif"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
              <h4>Deals Reveal and Failed Page</h4>
              <p>At the end of game journey, it will showing reveal Deal Page (discount promotion page) here the look of the reveal page </p>
              <div class="center_images"><img src="images/mcdelivery/game-reveal.png"></div>
              <p>Users that already claim the deal  within the day  are unable to get the reveal deal anymore. So they will direct to the failed Page. We have prepare 2 failed Page</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Failed page for user who try to reveal the deal within the day</li>
                <li>Failed page when the deal reach the limit of number</li>
              </ul>
              <div class="center_images"><img src="images/mcdelivery/failed.png"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>We got positive feedback after the game launch. However we also got another input from the user.<i> <b>Most users didn't know that they only can play a game once within a day.</i> </b>  So they are always getting into failed pages. The user really often misses the terms and condition page.</p>
              <p>So we decided to put a popup after the user clicks the title, before they start playing a game.  So it will make them clear regarding game rule before they play the game.</p>
